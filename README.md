# Appendix

Although the following features were not implemented in the current version, they could have further enhanced the functionality of SoundWave:

JSON Web Tokens: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) provide a secure method for authentication and authorization in web applications. By implementing JWT in SoundWave, the system could have enhanced user authentication, ensuring secure access to user profiles and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Passport: By integrating Passport into SoundWave, the system could have provided simple and unobtrusive authentication for users, allowing for a seamless login and registration process.

Multilingual Support: support of multiple languages to cater to a diverse user base.

Feedback and Ratings: Users should have the option to provide feedback and ratings for their overall experience.

User profile functionalities: Users can create and manage their profiles, including personal information, order history, and payment details.

I hope to incoroporate these features in future.
